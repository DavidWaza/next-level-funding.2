    title: `Why Should I Join Nextlevelfunding?`,
    text: `Not having sufficient capital when trading can be a problem especially if you have the skillet and are profitable. For example trading your $1000 account and making 10% per month is $100 per month but if you can prove your profitability to us and pass our evaluation you could be trading up to $500,000. Now 10% on this size account equals $50,000 . So as you can see it is the same percentage amount but with our capital you have the option to make much larger withdrawals per month than your $1000 account.`,

After the first month the profit is then increased by 10% for the trader so the trader will then take 80% and NextLevelFunding will take 10% of the profits. After 3 payouts the trader will then be on a 90% Profit split. This only applies to traders who did not pass with the use of a HFT algorithm. Please see HFT profit split question for more information.`,
